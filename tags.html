            President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that could make it harder for state governments to block energy-development projects such as 
                a proposed coal-export terminal in southwest Washington that has failed to get a permit because of environmental concerns.

                In making the announcement, Trump lashed out at “state-level abuse of water-quality certifications.” He signed the order in Crosby, Texas, in the heart of oil and gas country, touting what business groups have been urging: faster approval of major energy projects.
                
                Gov. Jay Inslee, a candidate for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, issued a joint statement with state Attorney General Bob Ferguson that called the executive orders “an unprecedented assault on the right and obligation of every state to protect their waters and their communities.”
                
                State scrutiny of federal water-quality permits is called for by the Clean Water Act and enables state regulators to reject permits, or impose conditions.
                
                The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers guidance on how the states should weigh in on these permits. But the order declares this guidance “outdated,” causing “confusion and uncertainty” for energy developers, and instructs the EPA to conduct a review to see how it should be changed.
                
                State officials have been aware for months of the possibility of the Trump administration crafting this executive order.On Jan. 31, Democratic Gov. David Ige of Hawaii and Republican Gov. Doug Burgum of South Dakota — chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Western Governors’ Association — sent a letter to Trump questioning the need for “any federal action to amend or clarify federal policy.”

                In his speech Wednesday, Trump specifically blasted New York regulators’ denial of a permit for a natural-gas pipeline because it failed to meet water-quality standards.
                
                But Wednesday’s action is also widely seen as a response to the Washington Department of Ecology’s 2017 rejection of a water-quality permit for Millennium Bulk Terminals’ proposal in Longview. Developers had wanted to move as much as 44 million metric tons of coal annually — to arrive daily in up to 16 trains, each more than a mile long — through Cowlitz County. It would be the largest coal-export terminal in North America.
                
                Ecology’s decision angered coal-state Republicans, who contended state regulators were improperly biased against development of new fossil-fuel projects.
                
                “Washington state has hijacked the water quality certification process and blocked Wyoming coal from being exported,” declared Sen. John Barasso, R-Wyoming, in a statement that alleged Washington state’s “obstruction” was a result of politics, not water quality.
                
                State Department of Ecology director Maia Bellon, in announcing the decision, cited “too many unavoidable and negative impacts,” that included filling wetlands, dredging and the mile-long trains.</p>
